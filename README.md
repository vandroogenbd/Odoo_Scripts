# Odoo_Scripts
Odoo_Scripts is a collection of scripts I wrote to automate some of my work at Odoo. Feel free to re-use this however you see fit.

# TODO: complete this freaking README
(and add some actual install steps)

## Install
To enable autocompletion (assuming you have aliases setup correctly), add "source PATH_TO_REPO/.bash_completion" to ~/.bashrc.
